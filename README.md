for the auto play feature I had to make the video mute as some browsers including crome don't support autoplay video content thats not muted.

### Features Left to Implement



## Testing 

### Bugs


#### Solved bugs
Module Loading and Dependencies:

I determined that js code for the homepage relies on specific module loading or dependencies and by combining the two js scripts on one page file disrupt this. So I had to put them on seperate js files for the home page and the Work page

### Validator Testing


- **HTML**
  
- **CSS**
  
- **Accessibility**
  
## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - in my GitHub repository,  I navigated to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, I selected the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
